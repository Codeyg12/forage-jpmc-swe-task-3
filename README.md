# JPMC Task 3
Starter repo for task 3 of JPMC's Forage program

## Explanation
After following the steps I attempted to change the upper and lower bounds but it wasn't reaching near the upper bound no matter how long the time spent. I ended up going with the original number that was proposed minus the operator due to it being a fixed number. If we were to add the option to change the bounds I would change it back to using 1 + `upper_bound_variable` or 1 - `lower_bound_variable`. If the desire was to keep it a fixed range, i.e. 0.05, I would add a `bound_variable`.
